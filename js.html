        <h2>JAVA SCRIPT</h2>
        <p>What is JavaScript?
JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.

The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.

In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language called Java.
        </p>
        <p> <strong> Why is it called JavaScript? </strong></p>
        <p>When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.

          But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language with its own specification called ECMAScript, and now it has no relation to Java at all.</p>
        <p> <strong>Example of JavaScript:</strong></p>
         <button type="button"
onclick="dateAndTime();">
Click me to display Date and Time.</button>
<p id="input"></p>
